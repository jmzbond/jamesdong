As someone who grew up immersed in environmental sustainability, this reaction surprised me. But it was easy to see why; walking physically among hundreds of thousands of penguins & seals, I could see how much they reacted to my presence from even an Olympic swimming pool's distance away. With these photographs, I wanted to show the faces of those changed forever by decisions we make everyday, from half a planet away.",

Once a year, a national convention calls members together. Starting as strangers grasping at threads of commonality, these men leave as brothers woven together by a profound history and identity.",

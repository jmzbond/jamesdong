	            I recently went on an expedition to South Georgia, the Falkland Islands, & Antarctica. The entire trip I felt soâ€¦ big&#8212;like a giant whose next step would be a crush. As someone who grew up immersed in environmental sustainability, this reaction surprised me. But it was easy to see why&#8212;walking physically among hundreds of thousands of penguins & seals, I could see how much they reacted to my presence from even an Olympic swimming pool's distance away. With these photographs, I wanted to show the faces of those changed forever by decisions we make everyday, from half a planet away. <%= @extra_title %>

	            The Sigma Phi Society is the nation's oldest continually operating fraternity, yet it is also one of the smallest with only 10 chapters. Once a year, a national convention calls members together. Starting as strangers grasping at threads of commonality, these men leave as brothers woven together by a profound history and identity. <%= render 'layouts/contacttobuy' %>

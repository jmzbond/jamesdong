            I cook to eat and fuel myself through the long days. I cook to meditate; its one of the few activities where my mind doesn't wander. I cook to be in touch with society and culture on a more profound level. I don't really rely on recipes. They're useful for flavor combinations, but quantities should be determined by individual palate. I cook things that my mind tells me should taste good; most of the time I'm right.

            Below you can find snapshots of the dishes I've cooked, but this page is a work in progress. <a href="<%= new_contact_path %>">Tell me what you want to see</a>: recipes, ingredients, photos, reviews?
